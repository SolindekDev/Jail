    - 7th January 2023 - SolindekDev

Things to do:
    - Write function declaration parser implementation 
    - Write function call parser implementation
    - Write function that will parse values in Jail, it will work something like this it will get 1 argument that will be an token kind type that will represents the token to end parsing (i'm so terrible on translating my thinks)
    - Write implementation of variables
    - Try to make an simple program with functions and variables to generate fully working assembly
    - More to do things in a future
