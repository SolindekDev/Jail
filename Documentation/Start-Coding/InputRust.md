# Input Rust
You know that Jail i compiling into Rust Code so we added a special keyword `__rust` that will add your provided code! Here some example code:
```
__rust `println!("Hello, World!")`
```
This what code will be generated:
```rust
/* Code from __rust keyword */
println!("Hello, World!");
/* Code end. */
```
So that all about `__rust` keyword in **Jail**!
