# Variables
```
var name = "Andrew" # Create variable "name" with value "Andrew"
var age = 18 # Create variable "age" with value 18

puts name # Print out name
puts age # Print out age
```
Variables can be declared with the following syntax, keyword `var`, to change the value of the variable you need to use this code:
```
var name = "Andrew" # Create variable "name" with value "Andrew"

name = "Bob" # Change value of "name" variable to "Bob"

puts name # Print out name
```
This all about variables
